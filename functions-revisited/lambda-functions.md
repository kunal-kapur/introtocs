# Lambda Functions

We will now go over the one line function called the **lambda function**. We know we can write functions like this:

```text
def addFive(x):
    return x + 5
```

We can rewrite this function in the following syntax.

```text
lambda x: x + 4
```

This one liner called the lambda function can be quite useful and takes the form of:

```text
lambda parameter1 , parameter2 : some operations that you want to return
```

Lambdaâ€™s are essentially functions that have no variable name associated with them. Typically we want to use lambdas if we want to do some quick operation or mapping and want to save it. It is important to realize that lambda functions are no different than other functions. For example, if we have:

```text
>>> x = lambda x : x + 5
```

We can evaluate the function on the argument 6 by doing.

```text
>>> x(6)
11
```

This is no different the same way we apply arguments on variables equal to normal functions. This means that whenever we create a lambda function we do no call it \(even if there is no parameter- in this case it is just equivalent to a function with no parameter\). This is a small point but a very important one.

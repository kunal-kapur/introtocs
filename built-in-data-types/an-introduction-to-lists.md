# An Introduction to Lists

We have gone over how variables can be assigned to one value, but let’s go up one more step. Now, we will assign variables to sequences of values. The first object that we will go over that fits this criteria is called the **list**.

Lists, as the name implies, store a list of values. For example. The way that we instantiate a list is as follows:

```text
>>> lst = [1, 2, 10, ”Kettle Corn”] 
>>> lst
[1, 2, 10, ”Kettle Corn”]
```

# Tuples

Tuples are just like lists except they are immutable. In other words, once a tuple is initialized it cannot be changed. Unlike lists, we initialize tuples with parentheses rather than square brackets. Tuples can be indexed in the same way as lists; however, tuple indices can never be reassigned, nor can anything be added or removed.

A tuple is created as follows:

```text
>>>tup = (1,2,3)
>>>tup
(1,2,3)
>>>tup[1]
2
```

Because we cannot remove anything from a tuple, that means we cannot pop or add elements.

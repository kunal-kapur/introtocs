```python
a = 1
b = 1
b, a = a+b,b
```

b.  What would be the value of z after this code has run?

```python
def func1(x,y):
    return xâˆ—y
z=func1(10,2)
```



c. What is the value of p after this code has run?

```python
def func2(a):
    return a*a
p = 10
p = func2(p)
```

d. Why will the following code not run properly?

```python
def hi(y):
    return 2 
z=hi(z)
```

e. What does the following code display?

```python
def adder(x,y): 
    return x+y 
f = adder(2)
```

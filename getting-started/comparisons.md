# Comparisons

In Python, we can check use a few operators to check if 2 values are equal. The first one we will go over is ”==”. This operator returns True if 2 values are equal and False otherwise.

```text
>>>a=1 
>>>b=1
>>>c=2
>>>a==b
True
>>>a==c
False
```

In addition to equality, we can also check for inequality using the ”!=” operator. In contrast, this operator returns True if 2 values are not equal and False otherwise.

```text
>>> a != c 
True
>>> a != b 
False
```

The above operators check for equality and inequality for all the types that we have gone over so far; however, there are a few important operators that can be used to compare numerical values. These includes &gt; \(greater than\), &lt; \(less than\), &gt;= \(greater than or equal to\), and &lt;= \(less than or equal to\).

```text
>>>d=5 
>>>e=3
>>> f = 5
>>> f > d 
False
>>> e<d
True
>>> f>=d
True
>>> d > e 
True
```

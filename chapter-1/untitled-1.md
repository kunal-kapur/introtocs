# Python

The programming language that we will be going over in this book is Python. Python is an English-esque language and a lot of the logic that holds in English will also tend to hold in Python. 

To run Python, if you work on a Mac, simply go to the terminal and type in ”python3”. However, we may not always want to work on the terminal, since it be a lot more difficult to compose larger programs. As a result, we can work with an IDE or text editor, my personal favorites are PyCharm and Atom. IDE’s let you do some really useful processes such as debugging your code and running in a simplistic eye appealing environment; however, text editors will allow you to have a light weight interface where you can simply code and run on the terminal.

 Whenever there are examples, run python3 in your terminal and copy the input. It will help with your understanding of the material. If there are some parts that are vague, go to [Pythontutor](http://pythontutor.com/). It is an amazing website that helps you visualize your code.
